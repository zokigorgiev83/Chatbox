# Chatbox

This is a chatbox, or shoutbox, written in PHP with the utilization of MySQL, jQuery, AJAX, CSS and HTML technologies. I used MAMP to build the database and test the program on the local server. The program was written in Netbeans. It is based on the course "Projects In JavaScript & jQuery" (Chapter 5) on Udemy.
